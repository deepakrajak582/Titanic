Titanic Passenger Survival - Classification Problem
Titanic Survival Problem in which we are going to predict the survival of the passenger.
As you can see, here we are predicting only two possible outcomes - survived or not survived 
so this becomes a binary classification problem. 
I will be doing this in python because I find python very easy to learn and it has variety of useful machine learning packages. 
So, letâ€™s start with step by step process to find out if you would have been on the great titanic ship then in which criteria you would have survived?
we will find it out this by end of our process.
